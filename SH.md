问题1–请告诉我们您在华威学习这门硕士课程的动机，以及您在完成学业后对未来的愿景或计划。（2500个字符限制-包括空格）*

#### 学习动机

- 从小对汽车的喜爱

  我来自中国，一个汽车保有量超过三亿的世界第一汽车大国，并且仍在高速增长中。受到同样喜欢汽车的父亲的影响，我从小就对与汽车相关的一切充满了浓厚的兴趣。各大汽车品牌的经典车型我都十分了解，包括他们的历史、设计与性能参数等。能够使用捷豹路虎的车型进行学习甚至也是我进入SCAV专业学习的原因之一，因为我喜欢他们的优雅与绅士的特点，正如阿斯顿马丁、劳斯莱斯和宾利等其他英国汽车一样。

  从内燃机车到电动汽车与氢能源汽车，汽车工业获得了巨大的发展，这也是人类科技文明发展的成果。从杂志到电视节目再到互联网，获取汽车信息的渠道也越来越多，我也看着每一季top gear长大成人。因此在进入大学的机会中，我选择了自动化专业，一个结合了控制、计算机与电子的工程专业，我想通过学习知识的方式继续更好地了解汽车甚至改进或创造汽车。（1200）

  

  I come from China, a country with more than 300 million cars and still growing at a high speed. Influenced by my father, who also likes cars, I have been deeply interested in everything related to cars since my childhood. I know all the classic models of the major brands, including their history, design, and performance.

  Being able to study with Jaguar Land Rover is even one of the reasons I enter the SCAV program, as I like their elegance and gentlemanly features, just like other British brands. From fuel cars to electric vehicles and hydrogen vehicles, the automobile industry has achieved tremendous development, which is also the result of the development of human science and civilization. Therefore, when I entered the university, I chose to major in automation, an engineering major that combines control, computer and electronics. I want to continue to better understand cars and even improve or create cars by learning knowledge. (1157)

  

- 本科学习与科研探索

  在本科学习期间，我不断积累电子、控制和计算机方面的知识与技能，与此同时，新能源汽车与自动驾驶获得了飞速发展，在全世界范围内出现了许多相关公司，包括传统和新兴汽车厂家。在中国，这样的趋势格外明显。最近几年成立的以自动驾驶为特点的汽车公司在中国被称为“造车新势力”，他们的产品强调性能与科技，以爆发式增长试图挑战传统汽车大厂的地位。因此我想根据我的兴趣与专业所学，进入自动驾驶行业工作，并以此作为我的阶段性目标。
  
  During my undergraduate study, I have continuously accumulated knowledge and skills. Meanwhile, new energy vehicles and autonomous driving have achieved rapid development, and many related companies have emerged around the world. This trend is particularly pronounced in China. The auto companies that have been established in recent years to feature autonomous driving are known in China as the "new car manufacturers", and their products emphasize performance and technology, with explosive growth trying to challenge the position of traditional car manufacturers. Therefore, I want to work in the autonomous driving industry according to my interests and professional knowledge, and this is my phased goal. (788)



- SCAV课程匹配度与实践机会

  SCAV专业提供了与自动驾驶相关的全面知识，并且与路虎等公司合作提供了学习条件与实践机会。其中，不光有嵌入式系统、传感器、机器智能、网络通信等技术性课程，还有人机交互、汽车管理课程，这是非常少见的。我相信我能够从知识与实践两个方面，深入学习自动驾驶。

  The SCAV program provides comprehensive knowledge related to autonomous driving and offers practical opportunities in collaboration with Land Rover and other companies. Among them, there are not only embedded systems, sensors, machine intelligence, network communication ,and other technical courses, but also human-technology interaction, and automobile management courses, which are very rare. I believe that I can deeply learn autonomous driving from both knowledge and practice. (482)

#### 毕业后愿景或计划

- 进入机器人与自动驾驶相关行业工作

- 承担具体的开发任务并做出高质量的产品

- 在中国宣传汽车科技与文化

毕业后，我想回到中国进入汽车与自动驾驶行业工作，在我擅长并感兴趣的方向承担具体的开发任务并做出高质量的产品，让更多人享受到自动驾驶的便利。工作之外，我还想在中国宣传自动驾驶科技与汽车文化，为更多喜欢汽车的学生们提供了解这个行业的机会，为他们提供自动驾驶相关知识，比如与大学社团合作，举办一些参观与讲座。总之，我想为正在蓬勃发展的汽车产业与汽车文化做一些有意义的事情。

After graduation, I want to work in the automobile and autonomous driving industry. I want to take on specific development tasks and make high quality products in the direction I am good at and interested in, so that more people can enjoy the convenience of autonomous driving. Outside of work, I also want to promote car culture in China, and provide more students who like cars with the opportunity to learn about the industry, such as working with university clubs to organize tours and lectures. In short, I want to do something meaningful for the booming automobile industry and car culture.

##### **Question 2 – Please tell us about your previous experience (professional or voluntary) and/or any extra-curricular activities that you have been involved in, which are relevant to your study on this MSc programme. (1500 character limit – including spaces)** *****

问题2–请告诉我们您之前的经验（专业或志愿）和/或您参与过的任何与本硕士课程学习相关的课外活动。（1500个字符限制-包括空格）*

During my undergraduate study, I completed a program for college students and was awarded the national level. The neural network of YOLOv3 was trained by using specific types of images, and the detection of six types of images was realized. This work was published in ICCE-TW 2020. In my graduation project, I realized the automatic segmentation of the road part of the lidar point cloud in the road environment, which can be used for SLAM. The thesis was awarded as an outstanding thesis.

After my graduation, with a strong desire for autonomous vehicles, I, as a full-time research assistant, joined the State Key Lab of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, which is an advanced lab in China. There, I participated in a project called High-speed Mobile Machine Vision Perception as the project leader. This project studied the motion blur in images and the application of high frame rate event cameras to this problem. I proposed an image registration method based on image region segmentation, and two papers indexed by EI were published.

After that I researched the indoor positioning of UAVs, using binocular cameras fused with IMU to achieve high precision positioning. Based on this, I did two engineering projects, one is a UAV-based position tracking system for swimmers, and the other is a mobile platform-based autonomous landing system for UAVs. One of the projects has been published as an EI-indexed paper. The other is under research and expected to be submitted to SCI-indexed journals. 



我的名字是桑帆，我的学生ID是001. 在五月份我收到了贵校机器人与人工智能专业的录取通知。我在六月交了这个录取的留位费。然而，我目前的情况恐怕不能允许我前往英国开始这个项目。我想申请放弃这个机会。

请允许我描述一下我目前的糟糕情况，我来自中国，并且中国的新冠疫情防控政策一直很严格，不幸的是，我所在的城市在今年夏天遭遇了严重的疫情，政府采取了严格的防控措施，包括禁止一些商业活动，我家的产业因此受到了很大的影响，我父母的收入急剧下降，并且花费了很多积蓄，无力负担过多我的学习与生活费用。因此，这笔留位费对于现在我的家庭来说十分重要。

能够获得前往格拉斯哥大学读书的机会对我来说是非常珍贵和幸运的，但是现实的经济压力让我不得不放弃这个机会，我感到非常地遗憾与抱歉，希望能获得学校的理解与帮助。

最后，我非常希望学校可以退回留位费，我为此带来的不便道歉。如果可以获得允许，我将无比感激。



My name is Fan Sang (student ID: 2806228) and I received an unconditional offer for Msc of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence in March this year (Application number: 01039689). I have paid the deposit fee for this program in April. But I am afraid that my current situation does not allow me to go to the UK to start this program. I would like to apply for a waiver of this opportunity.

Please allow me to describe my current situation. I am from China, and China has a very strict policy on the prevention and control of the COVID-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, my city was hit by a serious epidemic this summer, and the government took strict measures, including traffic control and banning business activities. My parents' income has dropped significantly and they have spent a lot of savings. So they cannot afford to pay too much for my studies and living expenses. Therefore, this deposit fee is very important to my family now.

The opportunity to study at the University of Glasgow is very precious and fortunate for me, but I am very sorry and regretful that I have to give up this opportunity due to financial pressure.

Finally, I really hope that I can get the deposit fee. I would like to apologize for any inconvenience caused by this. I will be grateful.
